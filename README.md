## Random ideas

- first person view, moving around the map, You can see things normally.
- On the top-down map it draws with lidar-like hits.  So you can see outlines of stuff.
- You are exploring, looking for an exit.
- You can find:
  - better scanner that detects further away
  - scanner upgrade that detects longer (like a memory upgrade?)
- Challenges:
  - Find the exit
  - Avoid or disable the haywire robots


Start with a melee weapon  (ie. a laptop or phone for hacking).  Can get some ranged weapon.
