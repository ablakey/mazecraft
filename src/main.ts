/**
 * This seems wrong but it's just really convenient given we're single-threaded and these are always-defined singletons.
 * It would make testing tricky, but I'm not planning on any.  It would make re-use tricky but I don't plan on that.
 * I'm leaving "World" as part of game because it will change as we load new worlds (aka. levels/floors).
 *
 * This can also make discovery difficult for people not familliar with the code. Ie. "where is game getting defined?"
 *
 * tl;dr: you probably don't want to do this in any sort of production code.
